title: Configuration
description: Every environment variable the bot reads, with defaults.
---

Configuration is read from environment variables (see `.env.example`). The AI
variables are the ones you will change per provider:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_API_KEY` | API key for the AI provider | _(required)_ |
| `AI_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible base URL | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` |
| `AI_MODEL` | Chat model name | `deepseek-chat` |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | Provider label for telemetry (`gen_ai.provider.name`); derived from `AI_BASE_URL` when unset | _(derived)_ |
| `AI_TIMEOUT` | Per-request timeout | `300s` |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` | GitHub App ID | _(required)_ |
| `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` | GitHub App private key (PEM) | _(required)_ |
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook HMAC secret | _(required)_ |
| `GITHUB_BOT_LOGINS` | Comma-separated bot account login(s) the bot skips to avoid replying to itself; override when deployed under a different App slug (`<app-slug>[bot]`) | `thrillhousebot[bot],thrillhouse-bot[bot]` |
| `WEBHOOK_DEDUP_TTL` | Webhook deduplication time-to-live for GitHub redeliveries | `24h` |
| `THRILLHOUSEBOT_REVIEW_MANUAL_TRIGGER_ALLOWED_LOGINS` | Comma-separated allowlist of logins permitted to trigger manual `/review` without repo access | _(empty)_ |
| `MANUAL_TRIGGER_AUTH_TIMEOUT` | Upper bound on the manual-trigger write-access check on the webhook ACK thread; fails closed (denies) if GitHub is slower | `5s` |
| `WEBHOOK_SKIP_DRAFTS` | Skip auto-review while a PR is a draft (reviewed once marked ready / on later pushes) | `false` |
| `WEBHOOK_REQUIRED_LABELS` | Comma-separated labels; only auto-review PRs carrying at least one (case-insensitive) | _(empty — no gate)_ |
| `WEBHOOK_EXCLUDED_LABELS` | Comma-separated labels; skip auto-review of PRs carrying any (wins over required) | _(empty)_ |
| `WEBHOOK_BASE_BRANCHES` | Comma-separated globs; only auto-review PRs whose base branch matches one (e.g. `main,release/*`). Globs are gitignore-style: `*` does **not** cross `/`, so use `**` to span slashes (`**` alone matches every branch) | _(empty — all branches)_ |
| `WEBHOOK_IGNORED_BASE_BRANCHES` | Comma-separated globs; skip auto-review of PRs whose base branch matches one (wins over allowlist; same `*`/`**` rule — match nested branches with `**`, e.g. `dependabot/**`) | _(empty)_ |
| `REVIEW_CONVERSATIONAL_REPLIES_ENABLED` | Answer `@thrillhousebot` mentions in PR threads (including finding replies) with an AI reply | `true` |
| `REVIEW_ADD_DOCS_ENABLED` | Allow the on-demand `/add-docs` command to generate docstrings as committable suggestions | `true` |
| `REVIEW_DIAGRAM_ENABLED` | Include an opt-in Mermaid control-flow diagram in the PR summary | `false` |
| `REVIEW_LABELS_ENABLED` | Opt in to context-aware PR labels (see [PR labels](#pr-labels)) | `false` |
| `REVIEW_LABELS_APPLY` | When labels are enabled, add them to the PR instead of only suggesting them in a comment | `false` |
| `REVIEW_LABELS_ALLOW_CREATE` | Allow the bot to create suggested labels that don't exist yet | `false` |
| `REVIEW_LABELS_MAX` | Maximum labels applied or suggested per PR | `3` |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth credentials for dashboard login | _(required for dashboard)_ |
| `DASHBOARD_URL` | Public dashboard URL (OAuth callback base) | `http://localhost:8080` |
| `DATASOURCE_DB_KIND` | `h2` or `postgresql` | `h2` (dev), `postgresql` (`%prod`) |
| `HTTP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` | Outbound HTTP connect timeout (GitHub API, OAuth) | `10s` |
| `HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | Outbound HTTP request timeout (GitHub API, OAuth) | `10s` |
| `WEBSOCKET_KEEPALIVE_MS` | Dashboard WebSocket keepalive interval in ms; `0` or negative disables it (and stale replay-buffer eviction) | `25000` |

The app validates configuration at startup and **fails fast** if a required value
(`GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `AI_API_KEY`) is missing or — for
the private key — not a valid PEM RSA key, naming every offending variable in one message instead of
surfacing later on the first webhook or review. Dashboard OAuth (`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` /
`GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`) is optional: leave both unset and the dashboard login is simply disabled.

Cost tracking uses per-model pricing keyed by the model name, for example:

```properties
thrillhousebot.ai.pricing.deepseek-chat.input-per-1k=0.00014
thrillhousebot.ai.pricing.deepseek-chat.output-per-1k=0.00028
```

If you switch to a different `AI_MODEL`, add a matching
`thrillhousebot.ai.pricing.<model>.*` pair so the dashboard can compute cost.

## PR labels

ThrillhouseBot can suggest context-aware labels (area, change type, risk) drawn
from the diff. The feature is **off by default**; turn it on with
`REVIEW_LABELS_ENABLED=true`.

When enabled, the model is shown the repository's existing labels and picks the
few that best describe the PR — it only ever chooses from labels that already
exist, so it respects whatever label scheme the repo already uses. What happens
next depends on `REVIEW_LABELS_APPLY`:

- `false` (default): the suggestions are posted as a one-line comment on the
  first review, leaving the decision to a maintainer.
- `true`: the labels are added to the PR automatically.

Set `REVIEW_LABELS_ALLOW_CREATE=true` to let the bot create a suggested label
that doesn't exist yet (off by default, so it never invents labels), and
`REVIEW_LABELS_MAX` to cap how many labels it applies or suggests (default `3`).
Labelling is best-effort — a failure here never blocks or fails the review.
